# Welcome!

Contributions to this repository are highly encouraged. However, before you start, please read the following guidelines.

- **Open an issue first.** If you're planning on making a large change, or if you're not sure if a change is necessary, open an issue first. This will allow us to discuss the change and make sure it's something we want to add.
- **Keep things organized.** Website files go in the `website` directory, database configuration goes in the `database` directory, etc.
- **Run the tests.** Before you submit a pull request, make sure all the tests pass. A script that runs the tests is coming soon.
- **Be descriptive.** Your commits (and especially your pull request) should be descriptive. Don't be overly verbose, but make sure the description is clear and concise. "Fixed a bug" is not a good description, but "Fixed a bug where the user couldn't log in" is.
