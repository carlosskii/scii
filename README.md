### SCII IS CURRENTLY IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT. IT IS NOT USABLE IN ANY FORM.

Software Collaboration Is Innovative (SCII) is a distributed network of developers designed for collaboration and innovation. It is designed to be both lightweight and scalable, so projects of any size can utilize it. While self-hosting is highly encouraged, a public instance will also be available.

## Features

- **Distributed** - SCII has no central authority. It is designed to be decentralized and distributed, allowing anyone to host their own instance.
- **Lightweight** - Since there is no central server to manage, SCII can be run on very low-spec hardware.
- **Scalable** - If your project grows beyond your hardware, you can utilize the power of other instances to help you out.
- **Fast** - SCII uses Svelte for the frontend UI, and Rust for the backend. Both of these languages are designed for speed and efficiency.
- **Powerful** - Even though SCII is lightweight, it doesn't sacrifice functionality. From VCS to issue tracking to collaborative discussion, many features are available out of the box.
- **Extensible** - If there's a feature you'd like but isn't available, you can easily create your own extension to add it.
